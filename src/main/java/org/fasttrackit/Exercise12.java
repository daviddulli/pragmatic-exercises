/*
Computing simple interest is a great way to quickly figure
out whether an investment has value. Itâ€™s also a good way
to get comfortable with explicitly coding the order of operations in your programs.
Create a program that computes simple interest. Prompt for
the principal amount, the rate as a percentage, and the time,
and display the amount accrued (principal + interest).
The formula for simple interest is
A = P(1 + rt), where P is
the principal amount, r is the annual rate of interest, t is the
number of years the amount is invested, and A is the amount
at the end of the investment.
